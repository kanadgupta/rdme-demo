This repo contains a minimal example of a GitHub Actions workflow that syncs an OpenAPI definition from GitHub to [ReadMe](https://readme.com). It's powered by [the `rdme` GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rdme-sync-to-readme). You can view the resulting reference docs [here](https://rdme-demo.readme.io).
